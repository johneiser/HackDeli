# HackDeli
A library of hacking techniques.

[About]: HackDeli contains techniques often used (and often forgotten) pertaining to a variety of penetration test scenarios, centered around Kali Linux.  HackDeli requires two files to run (hackdeli.py, hackdelidata.xml).  Note, hackdeli.py will parse the hackdelidata.xml located in the current directory, so it must be executed locally to succeed.

[Warning]: These scripts come as-is with no promise of functionality or accuracy. I strictly wrote them for personal use. I have no plans to maintain updates, I did not write them to be efficient and in some cases you may find the functions may not produce the desired results so use at your own risk/discretion. I wrote these scripts to target machines in a lab environment so please only use it against systems for which you have permission!!

[Modification, Distribution, and Attribution]: You are free to modify and/or distribute these scripts as you wish. I only ask that you maintain original author attribution and not attempt to sell it or incorporate it into any commercial offering (as if it's worth anything anyway :)

[Testing]: The included scripts were tested on Kali Linux version 4.6.0-kali1-686

Usage
-----------------

python hackdeli.py

* Note: Must be run locally to properly locate xml file
